    <h3><strong>PERSONAL DESCRIPTION</strong></h3>
    <p>A graduate of Biochemistry, Dee Vee Cee started learning about the financial markets in October of 2019, a time when he should have been preparing for his final examinations. He started at first with forex, and after studying so much, from indicators like moving averages, the MACD and the RSI to more complex methods like BTMM, ICT, WWA, Wyckoff and Elliot Waves, he moved into learning about cryptocurrencies about a year later in 2020.</p>
    <p>He together with a few friends made some money in the 2021 bull run, as well as lost some money for failing to take profits. He has ever since advanced in learning about the markets as well as how the Blockchain works. He has delivered talks about cryptocurrencies across a host of events in which he was invited to speak.</p>
    <P>At present, he is working on some economic models to profit off the crypto markets in the coming bull run, which he expects to be in 2025, should history repeat itself.</P>
